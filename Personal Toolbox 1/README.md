My version of this Personal Toolbox is written in JavaScript, along with a webpage to display the generated SVG files. 
The webpage has examples of four different ways I could generate the Sainte-Victoire en Rouge, and has download links for each of the SVGs generated.
The generator function uses an Array of Objects to reference the data of each object, including height, width, color, rotation, and position.

The website can be viewed at "https://people.rit.edu/aob6548/531/Personal%20Toolbox%201/"
